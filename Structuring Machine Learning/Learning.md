#Why ML strategy?

There are so many thing we can do to  improve accuracy of our ML model.
Collect more data.
Collect more diverse training set.
Train algorithm longer with gradient descent.
Try Adam instead of gradient descent.
Try bigger network.
Try smaller network (over fitting).
Try dropout, L2 regularization.
Changing network architecture - Activation Function, Hidden Unit etc.
